    <h2>Here is one of Helene's Poems</h2>


    <p>Wake up at four I can’t go back to bed.<br>
My sleep’s not strong and neither is my head.<br>
Stand up and stretch and put my slippers on,<br>
My coffee pot whistles, unlike my yawn.</p>
<p>Six cups, two eggs and toast covered with spread.<br>
Some happy dreams go bad, so did my bread.<br>
In my old fridge a slice of cake left-over,<br>
I keep chewing its mouthfuls like a prayer.</p>
<p>It’s eight, but dark. September’s clouds betrayed <br>
My shirt, my skirt; my day can’t be delayed.<br>
I shut the door and step out in the rain.<br>
It rusts my skin, watering it in vain.</p>
<p>At ten, night time, I close my puffy eyes.<br>
The water in my bath is warm and wise,<br>
My eyelids’ screen just dappled, still and red.<br>
I lie and I remember what we prayed</p>
<p>For in the mid of the summer,<br>
That we could someday see each other <br>
Again. Which is not happening. <br>
So at midnight, I’m there again, waiting.</p>
